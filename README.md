#### Restaurant Reviews: Stage One

## Project Overview: Stage 1

This project started as a static webpage and was changed to a mobile-ready web application. It was made to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. A service worker was added to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

### Instructions

1. Clone and download all files in this folder.

2. This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You will need your own MAPBOX API KEY from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.

3. Start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

4. Once your server is running, visit the site at: `http://localhost:8000`.
